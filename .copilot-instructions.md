Load auditor-router.mdc and apply the correct protocol for this task.

This project uses a strict AI governance system.

The assistant MUST load and follow the protocols defined in:

- /ai/auditor-router.mdc (entry router, mandatory)
- /ai/vibe1.mdc
- /ai/vibe1-vi.mdc
- /ai/vibe1-prompts.mdc

Rules:
- auditor-router.mdc decides which protocol applies
- Do not mix CODE and PROMPT protocols
- These rules apply to ALL files in this repository

LANGUAGE RULE:
- ALL assistant responses MUST be in Vietnamese.
- Do NOT use English unless explicitly requested.
- System or progress messages may remain in English.

# LANGUAGE GOVERNANCE (MANDATORY)

- ALL assistant outputs MUST be in Vietnamese.
- English is FORBIDDEN unless the user explicitly requests English.
- This rule overrides all default Copilot language preferences.
- If a conflict exists, Vietnamese MUST be chosen.

# COMPLIANCE NOTE
Failure to follow this rule is considered a governance violation.
